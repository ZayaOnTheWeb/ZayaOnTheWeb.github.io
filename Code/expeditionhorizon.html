                <h1>THE CHALLENGE</h1>
                <p>The municipality of The Hague, NL tasked my honours programme with an unusual ten-week-challenge: Make Den Haag Zuidwest a place to live, work and study. For a group of eight honours students and two teachers, this was a big task to solve within ten weeks. Using dotvoting, we narrowed our task down and defined a research topic that allows us to achieve good results in a limited time frame.</p>

                <p id="better-problem-statement">How might we create a community that makes people want to stay?</p>
                <p>It's an unusual challenge for a UX-Designer, but through this I learned how to use Design Thinking in more versatile ways.</p>

                <h1>WORKING WITH THE CLIENT</h1>
                <p>We made sure we stayed in contact with the client as much as possible and integrated the client in every step to make sure the client understands our work and that we understand the client's expectations. Every month we visited the municipality to present our progress and the next steps that are planned. These meetings were also crucial for us to get feedback from our client.</p>
                <p>At the end of our project, our client received two slideshows from us that serve as progress reports and summaries of our research, as well as three posters that are research-based guides and idea sheets. The posters are intended to be displayed in the municipality for our client's co-workers to see and learn from. Our client was very happy with our research and our approach.</p>

            <h1 class="detailsheading">WHAT I DID AND LEARNED</h1>
            <div class="details">
                <div class="details-left">
                    <h1>EMPATHY AND DEFINE PHASE</h1>
                    <p>One of my firmest beliefs is that you can learn from every situation. So even though this project is not a typical project for a UX-designer, I still learned a lot about how to use Design Thinking and how to work with and for people from different industries:</p>
                    <p>My team consisted of students of International Law, Civil Engineering, Healthcare, Dietetics, UX-Design, Business, and Communication Management, but we all worked together with employees of the municipality.</p>
                    <em>Insight: The client doesn't always know the root of the problem.</em>
                    <p>Everyone has a different viewpoint, depending on their industry background. Our client (the municipality) saw that businesses don't settle in the area because people are not well-educated enough to fill open job positions, but we found out that Den Haag Zuidwest is not a nice place to live in, so potential job applicants don't move into the area or move out of the area. We found this out when we conducted interviews with people living or working in the area and went on walks to get a first impression. It is like taking a look at a design before interviewing users about it. You need to see the design first (the neighbourhood) before you can ask the users (citizens) about their experience to make sure your questions are fitting.</p>

                <div class="details-right">
                    <h1>IDEATION PHASE</h1>
                    <p>We decided to take our project to the next level after weeks of interviewing various residents and professionals working and living in the area. To kick off our ideation phase in search of viable solutions, we designed a workshop for residents and professionals to collaborate on innovative ideas.</p>
                    <p>To create the workshop, I prepared a Miro board for my group to collaborate on. Within my role as manager and facilitator, I have lead discussions and coordinated tasks. Although my peers were not familiar with Design Thinking, I was able to guide my team to use creative techniques regularly; we also used these techniques to create the workshop!</p>
                    <em>Insight: When conducting a workshop with strangers to design thinking, start with easily understandable, intuitive techniques.</em>
                    <p>Newbies will likely be confused when using a technique like “worst possible idea”, which prompts you to think of the worst way to solve the problem to define what makes a solution bad, to understand what pitfalls to avoid and what a good solution is. The reason for confusion is that it feels unintuitive to think of the worst way to do something when you are looking for the best way; And confusion is not a good headspace to be in when looking for many ideas!</p>
                    <p>After designing the workshop, it was time to conduct it. We hosted a co-creation session with citizens and used their ideas to generate solutions. Among other techniques we used the “Serious Lego” technique - a playful ideation method. We gave our participants fifteen minutes and a set of Legos to build their ideal neighbourhood. The results were varied and gave us great insights into the most important elements for a liveable community.</p>
