                <h1>WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT</h1>
                <p>As part of my university studies, I chose a minor in Healthcare that combines Design Thinking with dietetics. I want to see how I can apply my knowledge of UX in different industries. By completing a minor in healthcare I learned how to work with medical professionals when designing, which is important because UX Design is everywhere, even in medical settings.</p>

            <div class="right-column">
                <h1>WHAT THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT</h1>
                <p>The target group of our project is people with Binge Eating Disorder (BED). BED is one of the most common but most underdiagnosed eating disorders. It is very stigmatized despite the prevalence of the word “binge” in everyday conversations. A lot of patients feel shame about their eating patterns, which is why they don't talk about it and don't want to get help.</p>   
                <p>We took three weeks for each design phase to come up with an end product that can help solve this struggle. Throughout my portfolio I will thoroughly explain our design process.</p>
                <p>The target group of our project is people with Binge Eating Disorder. My group and I interviewed patients and created an empathy map to compile our insights. This empathy map helped us define our problem and create a problem statement, which lead us during ideation sessions. What was once fifty ideas, was combined and sorted out by using the Now-How-Wow-Matrix and Reality Check creative techniques.</p>
                <p>The final product is a storytelling-based shared learning hub about BED (Binge Eating Disorder), which helps patients and their loved ones understand each other better.</p>

                    <h1>1. EMPATHY PHASE</h1>
                    <p>The empathy phase of design thinking is one of the most important ones to get right from the beginning, in my opinion. It lays the groundwork for everything that follows and has the worst impact when not done properly from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, I made sure that my research was done well and in depth. My group and I interviewed several BED patients and compiled the data gained into an empathy map and a persona. Doing this allowed us to easily work with our data in the following phases.</p>

                    <h1>3. IDEATION PHASE</h1>
                    <p>Initially, we generated 51 ideas based on our problem statement. Obviously, that is way to many ideas to work with, so I guided my team in various techniques to narrow down ideas. We used the dotvoting technique to determine our favorite ideas. Some of them were impractical so we made a “Now How Wow Matrix”. This technique allows us to separate ideas by how easily implementable or innovative they are - this helps us focus on the easy and innovative ideas that will yield the best results with appropriate effort. The graphic is pretty self-explanatory.</p>

                    <h1>5. TEST PHASE</h1>
                    <p>We sent our prototype to various dieticians practices and organizations to give us feedback about our platform and to also find out whether anyone is interested in implementing our idea.
                        Aside from this, we also tested with BED-patients directly to see whether they would like and use this platform and whether there are any features they don't like.</p>

                <div class="details-right">
                    <h1>2. DEFINE PHASE</h1>
                    <p>In the define phase we created a problem statement by identifying the root cause of our users' problems. We also further defined our target group and identified factors that may hold our users back. To see whether we are on the right track, we showed our problem statement to our users. The feedback was good and our direction was approved.</p>
                    <img src="pictures\problemstatement.png">
                    <h1>4. PROTOTYPE PHASE</h1>
                    <p>With the Wow-ideas from the last phase, we created a prototype for what we would like the website to look like. I created the prototype with Canva, a visual design application. I chose this platform because in the following phase I had to share my prototype with many of potential users, and a website prototype made with Canva can easily be shared without the need for test subjects to sign up (for instance like Figma).</p>
                    <p>To realistically showcase our innovative storytelling approach and forego the dreaded Lorem-Ipsum culture of prototypes, we asked our interview participants from our empathy phase to write stories for us. Through this we could also see what kinds of stories our platform would get and adjust our platform layout accordingly.</p>
