                <h1>THE TASK</h1>
                <p>This project is a part of my university's UX-Design major. Within this project, my project partner and I were prompted to redesign an existing web shop with a slightly lacklustre user experience.
                    We first analysed the website's weaknesses, then used a client-given persona to understand who we are designing for and what to keep in mind. This was important to know especially during the branding step, which dictated our visual direction in our HiFi-prototype.</p>

                    <h1>THE CLIENT, OR THE LACK THEREOF</h1>
                    <p>My client was Van Vien Dutch Delicacies (name changed), a webshop focused on delivering Dutch groceries to people in the United States. The website exists in real life, but has never really hired my university to redesign their website. However, as part of an assignment that focuses on turning bad UX into phenomenal UX, this “client” seemed to be the perfect challenge. </p>
                    <p>My university provided a premade persona of what a user of this website could be and the website itself. There was no client I could ask for feedback, as I usually would when redesigning something.</p>

                    <h1>THE REDESIGN</h1>
                    <p>Initially, we generated 51 ideas based on our problem statement. Obviously, that is way to many ideas to work with, so I guided my team in various techniques to narrow down ideas. We used the dotvoting technique to determine our favorite ideas. Some of them were impractical so we made a “Now How Wow Matrix”. This technique allows us to separate ideas by how easily implementable or innovative they are - this helps us focus on the easy and innovative ideas that will yield the best results with appropriate effort. The graphic is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
                    <p>This product details page offers breadcrumb navigation, easy-to-use buttons, and a translated ingredient list made for our Dutch users.</p>

                    <h1>OUR EXPERT REVIEW...</h1>
                    <p>...uncovered many problems in the navigational structure and the information architecture. The layout is confusing and not fit for current times. It is commendable when a company wants to stick to a design that their users have grown accustomed to over many years, but as a UX professional my advice is to at least try to adopt modern standards for the sake of accessibility. This layout was made for an era where a 4:3 ratio on monitors was common, which is a time long passed. On modern 16:9 or ultrawide screens, this design looks out of place, and on mobile, some content is hard to read without additional scrolling or zooming, which can be a challenge for users with impaired mobility.</p>
                    <p>A design like this SCREEAAAMSSS for a makeover. And being the benevolent UX-Designer I am, I granted its wish. Let me show you how:</p>
                    <h1>DESIGN DIRECTION AND BRANDING</h1>
                    <P>The persona illustrated that this website is aimed at Dutch expats, who long for a cultural connection to back home. To satisfy this craving, I decided to give them a traditionally inspired design with a modern twist.</P>
                    <P>We kept the color scheme but warmed it up with two yellow shades. These colors were also used in our logo which resembles a classic Dutch milkmeisje (milkmaid).</P>
                    <P>The heading font was chosen to give the website a whimsical, vintage feeling, similar to old Dutch newspapers, whereas the main body font is a modern and easily legible sans-serif font.</P>
